                <h1>Life Should be Easier...</h1>
                <p>And it can be. The Peripheral-Framework aims to simplify and streamline the proccess of creating peripherals 
                    for Minecraft mods such as <a href="http://www.computercraft.info/">ComputerCraft</a> 
                    and <a href="http://oc.cil.li/index.php?/page/index.html">OpenComputers</a><sup>Coming Soon!</sup>. By acting 
                    as a buffer between unnecessarily complex APIs and your code, this framework will give you the freedom to 
                    write code that is consice, maintainable, and beautiful.</p>

                    <h3>Why?</h3>
                    <p>What were the motivations behind making this framework, and how badly was it needed? That's a good question.</p>
                    <p>The issue with the native ComputerCraft API is that writing peripherals that are maintainable, readable, 
                        and beautiful is nearly impossible without considerable work. As it is, developers are forced to produce code 
                        that is both verbose and unintuitive. To see exactly what I mean by this, head over to 
                        the <a href="comparison.html">comparison</a> page and take a look at just how much the Peripheral-Framework 
                        improves your peripheral code.</p>

                <div class="the-how">
                    <h3>How?</h3>
                    <p>The Peripheral-Framework makes use of several Java annotations in order to interface between your code and 
                        the native mod APIs. In total, there are only <b>6</b> of these annotations that you need to worry about: 
                        and even then not all of them are required. If you want to see just how much this framework can do for
                        you, go ahead and check out <a href="docs.html">the documentation</a>.
