/**
 * Again this is your standard TileEntity class, however this is where your peripheral fun can happen.
 *
 * This class is annotated with the LuaPeripheral annotation, this tells the PeripheralProvider that
 * you wish this TileEntity to be available to ComputerCraft as a peripheral, with the peripheral type
 * specified through name.
 *
 * This class must then define methods it wishes to be accessible in Lua with the LuaFunction annotation.
 *
 * If you wish your peripheral to know when a computer is attached or detached from your peripheral, you
 * must define a method with the Attach and Detach annotations respectively. Note: you may only define
 * one of each method!
 *
 * It is suggested that you annotate your TileEntities with OpenPeripheral's Ignore annotation so that if
 * you implement anything such as IInventory on your TileEntity, OpenPeripheral will not attempt to claim
 * the peripheral as its own. Ignore annotation url:
 * https://github.com/OpenMods/OpenPeripheral/blob/master/src/main/java/openperipheral/api/Ignore.java
