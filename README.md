Peripheral Framework
====================

**IMPORTANT! This framework is intended for ComputerCraft 1.63 and any subsequent versions which make use of the same API**

An open-source framework that has the aim of allowing developers to implement their ComputerCraft peripherals faster, easier, and cleaner; allowing them to focus more on developing their content.

Why Use This?
-------------

- Good for developers<sup>1</sup>
- Good for users<sup>2</sup>


<sup>1</sup> This framework removes the need to define any of ComputerCraft's IPeripheral methods, thus decluttering your classes and making development quicker and easier.

<sup>2</sup> Better formatted error messages when the wrong data type, or number of arguments, is provided to your method from the Lua program. e.g. `expected string, got number`

Installation for Developers
--------------

As a developer, installing this framework is as simple as copying the contents of the `src` directory into your project: this includes dan200's ComputerCraft API if you do not have it installed to your project already.

It is suggested that you utilize [OpenPeripheral's `Ignore` annotation](https://github.com/OpenMods/OpenPeripheral/blob/master/src/main/java/openperipheral/api/Ignore.java) with TileEntities in order to prevent OpenPeripheral from claiming the peripheral as its own.

If you'd like to get an example of using this framework, a demo mod has been created [in the example](https://github.com/theoriginalbit/Peripheral-Framework/tree/master/example) folder. The documentation there should get you up and running with relative ease.


Installation for Users
--------------

If you are not a developer, you can install this framework by downloading the [current release](https://github.com/theoriginalbit/Peripheral-Framework/releases)<sup>1</sup> and dropping it into your mods folder.

<sup>1</sup> There aren't actually any releases yet.
